# Set Default Theme

This plugin is used to set the default theme for your users when they create their account.

### Install
1. Create a custom theme in your user settings: **Settings** -> **Display** -> **Theme**. You can find some example custom themes [here](https://avasconcelos114.github.io/mattermost-themes).
2. Copy the JSON representation for the theme you would like to make the default.
3. Navigate to the settings page for this plugin in the system console.
4. Paste the JSON string into the "Default Theme" config setting.

When any new account is created, the new user will have their theme set to this value.
